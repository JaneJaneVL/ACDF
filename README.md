Accelerated by Coupling Derivative-Free Method Computer Experiments with number of iterations required

Article: https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00162 (in Russian)

In the paper 1710.00162 we proposed an accelerated directional search method with non-euclidian prox-structure.
Here we generalize these results to accelerated gradient-free methods with inexact oracle 
(here we use the recent work of Dvurechensky, Gasnikov, Tyurin, 2017).
